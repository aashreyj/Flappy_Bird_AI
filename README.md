# Flappy Bird AI
This AI is using NEAT(Neuro-Evolution using Augmented Topologies) algorithm. It is intelligent enough to learnt o play the game of Flappy Bird on its own.

# Basic logic behind the training of the AI:

1. As the Ai goes as neural evolution, the first generation is populated with random weights and biases till a total of 50 bots.

2. As this generation progresses, and after all bot have "died" in the game , the bot with the best fitness is used to produce the 50 bots of the next generation.

3. This process repeats till it is clear that the AI has learnt how to play the game and can continue indefinitely.

# Real World applications:

Though this is a simple AI to play a fairly simple game of flappy bird, it can be complicated and made to be trained on a humaniod robot and teach it to walk and run, and thereby help humans reach places where it is phisically life threatening for humans to go.
